# Alfred Workflows

This directory contains a **showcase list** of the Alfred workflows I use. These workflows significantly boost my productivity across development, system management, and daily tasks.

## What's Included?

- **`workflows-i-use.md`** - Complete list of all 110+ workflows with descriptions
- Workflow metadata only (name, bundle ID, description, version)
- **No actual workflow files** (for security reasons - they contain API keys and personal config)

## Why Just a List?

Alfred workflows often contain:
- API keys and authentication tokens
- Personal paths and configurations
- Sensitive credentials
- System-specific settings

Rather than risk exposing sensitive data, I share this curated list to help others discover useful workflows. You can find and download these workflows from the official sources below.

## How to Find These Workflows

Search for workflows by name on:

- **[Alfred Gallery](https://alfred.app/workflows/)** - Official Alfred workflow gallery (recommended)
- **[Packal](http://www.packal.org/)** - Community workflow repository
- **GitHub** - Many workflows are open source and available via search
- **Alfred Forum** - [https://www.alfredforum.com/](https://www.alfredforum.com/)

## Workflow Categories

My workflows help with:

- **Productivity**: Snippet transformers, clipboard managers, timers, task management
- **Development**: Code snippets, GitHub integration, documentation search, VSCode workspace switching
